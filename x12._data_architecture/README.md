# Session 12: Data Architecture

**ITA Software Architecture 2026 Fall | 3 hours**

> Most of what an application *does* is move data between a user and persistent storage. Where it lives, how it's shaped, how reads and writes are routed, and how it *changes over time* are some of the highest-leverage decisions you make. Today we read a real one — **Gitea's** data model expressed in code, and the 261-migration history that has evolved it on live systems without downtime.

---

## Learning Goals

- Pick between relational and document storage with reasons.
- Read a real **relational data model expressed in code** — entities, keys, indexes, relationships.
- Reason about **normalisation vs. denormalisation** through read/write patterns.
- Read a real **migration** and judge whether it's safe to apply to a *running* system (expand–contract).
- Recognise the **read/write asymmetry** that drives almost every data decision.

---

## Before Class

- Have **Gitea** (v1.26.2) cloned/browsable — same codebase we met in S11.
- Bring the data model behind the API you sketched in the REST sessions (10–11) (a sketch is fine).
- [optional] One sentence: a place in a system you've built where you weren't sure how to model something.

## Today's Teachings

### Part 0 — The data behind your API (10 min)
In pairs, share the data model behind the API you sketched in the REST sessions (10–11). One thing you normalised, one thing you were tempted to duplicate. Two pairs share. Today we hold yours up against a real one.

### Part 1 — Storage families, and the relational default (25 min)
- **Relational** (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite) — strong consistency, joins, schemas.
- **Document** (MongoDB) — flexible shape, joins are your problem.
- **Key–value** (Redis) — fast, no querying beyond keys.
- **Wide-column** (Cassandra) — write-optimised, eventual consistency.
- **Search** (Elasticsearch) — full-text over denormalised data.

Honest framing: most apps — Gitea included — use **relational for the source of truth** and *maybe* one specialist store alongside (Gitea adds a search indexer, which we met in S11's fan-out).

### Part 2 — Back in Gitea: a real data model in code (30 min) — the set-piece
Open `models/issues/issue.go` and read the `Issue` struct. The `xorm:` tags on each field **are the schema**:

```go
type Issue struct {
    ID       int64                  `xorm:"pk autoincr"`          // primary key
    RepoID   int64                  `xorm:"INDEX UNIQUE(repo_index)"` // FK + index + composite unique
    Repo     *repo_model.Repository `xorm:"-"`                    // joined in memory, NOT a column
    Index    int64                  `xorm:"UNIQUE(repo_index)"`   // issue number within a repo
    PosterID int64                  `xorm:"INDEX"`                // FK to the user who opened it
    ...
}
```

Everything we'd draw on a schema diagram is here: a **primary key**, **indexes**, a **composite unique constraint** (`repo_index` — issue #5 is unique *within* a repo), **foreign keys** (`RepoID`, `PosterID`), and `xorm:"-"` for **relationships loaded by a join, not stored as a column**. And one model, several databases: `models/db/engine.go` runs the same schema on MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, or MSSQL.

Ask your agent: *"Describe the data model for a Gitea issue — its key, its indexes, and what it points at."* Then open the struct and check.

### Part 3 — Normalisation, denormalisation, reads vs. writes (25 min)
- **Normalisation is the default**: no duplication, one source of truth (the `Issue` row doesn't copy the repo's name — it stores `RepoID` and joins).
- **Denormalisation is sometimes correct**: when a read path is hot and a join is expensive, you store a derived value. Gitea keeps **counts and cached derived values** rather than recomputing them every page load.
- The lens behind both: **"optimise for the read or for the write?"** Almost every data decision is one or the other. Gitea is read-heavy (people browse far more than they write), and the model shows it.

### Part 4 — Schema evolution: migrations in the wild (30 min) — set-piece 2
A schema is never finished. Open `models/migrations/` — version folders `v1_6` … `v1_26`, holding **261 numbered migration files**, each a small function that changes the schema. `migrations.go` (`prepareMigrationTasks`) is the ordered registry, and the DB stores which version it's on.

Open one — e.g. `models/migrations/v1_24/v312.go`: a real change (`AddDeleteBranchAfterMergeForAutoMerge`) that adds a column via `x.SyncWithOptions(...)`.

The architectural discipline — the **expand–contract** pattern:

- Add the new shape, tolerate **both** old and new, backfill, switch reads, *then* drop the old shape.
- Because the database tolerates both during the transition, you roll the change out to a **live** system in stages and never force a breaking switch. Shipping the change and switching to it become separate steps — **"deploy ≠ release", applied to data**. (You'll meet "deploy ≠ release" again for *code* if you go on to a DevOps course; here it governs the schema.)
- This is why "just change the column" is fine on a toy app and catastrophic on a running one with 300 deploys of history.

### Part 5 — Workshop: a scenario becomes a data decision (25 min)
In pairs, take one quality-attribute scenario from S7 (e.g. *"the repo home page loads under 300 ms with 50k issues"*). What does it imply for data architecture — where do you index, denormalise, cache, or replicate? Sketch the storage decisions. One pair shares.

### Part 6 — Synthesis (10 min)
The bridge: a normalised model is correct but sometimes slow to read; **S13 (caching) is mostly about hiding slow reads**, and keeping those caches correct is an **event** problem (S18). Bring your "slow as written" notes next week.

## Exercise

Take the data model behind your 7–8 API. Half a page:

- For each table, note **who reads it** (often/rarely) and **who writes it** (often/rarely).
- Mark one query that is **slow as written**, and one value you'd consider **denormalising** to speed a read — and what it would cost you on writes.
- Sketch one **migration** you'd need for a plausible new feature, and say whether it's expand–contract-safe.

Bring it to session 13.

## Investigation (after class)

Ask your agent, **verify against Gitea's code**, write it up. Pick **two** of the three.

### Prompt 1 — Read a real table
> "In Gitea's `models/issues/issue.go`, describe the `Issue` model: its primary key, its indexes, its foreign keys, and which fields are *not* stored as columns (`xorm:\"-\"`)."

**Verify:** open the struct. For one index, say which query it speeds up. For one `xorm:"-"` field, say what join loads it. Note one thing the agent got right and one it fudged.

### Prompt 2 — Read a real migration
> "Open one file in `models/migrations/` (a recent `vNNN.go`). What schema change does it make? Would applying it break a *running, not-yet-updated* copy of Gitea during a rolling deploy?"

**Verify:** open the file. Is the change additive (expand-contract-safe) or destructive? What would make it unsafe?

### Prompt 3 — Find a denormalisation
> "Find one place where Gitea stores or caches a *derived* value (a count, a status) instead of computing it from a join every time. Why is that read path worth the extra write cost?"

**Verify:** open the file the agent names. Is the value really derived? What write has to keep it correct?

### Deliverable

Half a page:

- **What I investigated** — which two prompts.
- **One claim the agent got right** — and the file/symbol that proves it.
- **One claim that was vague, wrong, or oversold** — and how you checked.
- **One read/write asymmetry** — in your own words: a value that's cheap to read because something paid for it on write.

Bring it to session 13. First 10 minutes we compare.
