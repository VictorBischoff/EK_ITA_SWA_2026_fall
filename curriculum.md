# Curriculum — Software Architecture (ITA, Fall 2026)

**EK Business Academy Copenhagen** · 29 sessions × 3 hours

This course teaches software architecture as **decisions, boundaries, and conventions** — the rules a
system commits to so it can grow without collapsing under its own weight. Rather than drawing diagrams,
you'll **read real systems with an AI coding agent**, design small ones of your own, and learn to defend
your choices.

> **Method in one line:** read *structure*, not syntax. You'll open large real codebases (in languages
> you may not know) and use an agent to map how they're built — then verify its claims against the code
> yourself.

## What you'll do every teaching session

Each teaching-session README follows the same shape:

1. **Before Class** — a short reading or setup task.
2. **Part 0 — compare notes** — 10 min comparing last session's investigation with a partner.
3. **Today's Teachings** — the concepts, anchored to a *set-piece* in a real codebase you can open.
4. **Exercise** — an in-class task on your own project.
5. **Investigation (after class)** — ask your agent a question, **verify it against the code**, write up half a page.
6. **Optional** — canonical readings, never required (hands-on first).

*This is the rhythm of the architecture teaching sessions (6–13 and 18–21). The **IT-infrastructure foundations block**
(Sessions 2–5) is keyboard-first: setup, live teachings, and an in-class exercise you commit to Git —
no agent-investigation write-up.*

## What you need

- A laptop with **Docker Desktop** (introduced in Session 2, used throughout to run environments and examples).
- An **LLM coding agent** (e.g. Claude Code, Mistral Vibe) — the course's core tool.
- **Git / GitHub**, and the three codebases below cloned or browsable.

### The codebases you'll read

| Codebase | Role | Where it's used |
|---|---|---|
| `mistral-vibe-ek-ita` | The **spine** — a small CLI agent, the first real codebase you read | Sessions 6–9 |
| **Gitea** (pinned `v1.26.2`) | The **systems-half anchor** — a real server-side, multi-user, data-backed system | Sessions 11, 12–13, 18–20 |
| `ek-ita-swa-examples` | **Runnable** minimal examples (`docker compose up`) | Sessions 8, 9, 19 |

## Session overview

**Sessions 2–5** are the hands-on **IT-infrastructure foundations block**; architecture teaching runs
**Sessions 6–13** and **18–21** (with the project block at **14–17**); the exam project is **Sessions 22–29**. (Session 1 is a 3rd-semester intro session.)

| # | Topic | What you do |
|:-:|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Introduction to 3rd semester** | Semester overview and toolkit setup after the shared cross-teacher welcome — install Mistral Vibe, meet the wider agent landscape, watch a first agent investigation. No vocabulary taught. |
| **2** | **Terminal, Linux & Git** | Run a Linux machine in a container, navigate the shell, file permissions & processes, install software with a package manager (`apt`), save/push work with Git. Keyboard-first. |
| **3** | **Command line: pipes, HTTP & M2M security** | Streams/pipes/redirection & the text toolkit; `curl` + just-enough HTTP; securing machine-to-machine comms — HTTPS/TLS, certificates, bearer-token auth. |
| **4** | **Networking — how services talk** | Ports & listening processes, `localhost`/`0.0.0.0`, DNS, the client–server round-trip, reverse proxy / load balancer; why the network is unreliable (latency, timeouts, partial failure). |
| **5** | **Docker, Compose & the cloud** | Images vs containers, write a `Dockerfile`, multi-service `docker compose`; on-prem vs cloud (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), capex/opex. **Mandatory group assignment** issued. |
| 6 | **Intro to software architecture** | "Where is the architecture?" in real and toy systems. Set up your agent + the spine repo. |
| 7 | **Quality attributes** | Performance, scalability, availability, security, maintainability, cost — and the trade-offs between them. Quality-attribute *scenarios*. |
| 8 | **Layered architecture** | Identify layers in a real codebase; the downward dependency rule. Runnable bilingual (Kotlin + Python) notes service. |
| 9 | **Layered architecture (hands-on)** | Hands-on: live demo of a minimal two-layer Node.js notes service, then swap its persistence layer yourself — to a JSON API and to MongoDB in Docker. |
| 10 | **REST API I** | Probe a real API (GitHub) hands-on; REST constraints, resources, methods, status codes, idempotency. |
| 11 | **API contracts & OpenAPI** | The contract as a generated, CI-checked artefact — read Gitea's OpenAPI. *(Gitea is introduced here.)* |
| 12 | **Data architecture** | Read Gitea's data model in code (schema as ORM tags), migrations & expand–contract, normalisation vs denormalisation, read/write asymmetry. |
| 13 | **Caching & performance** | Gitea's cache-aside layer, Redis vs in-memory backends, the hard problem of invalidation, latency budgets. |
| **14–17** | **Project: small distributed system** | *No teaching.* Build a modular monolith, applying the architecture concepts from the course so far. |
| 18 | **Event-driven architecture** | Gitea's queue (one port, three brokers) and the event fan-out to webhooks; queues vs pub/sub, delivery & ordering guarantees. |
| 19 | **Microservices vs monoliths** | Gitea as a real *modular monolith*; run the same product as a monolith vs **polyglot** microservices (Kotlin + Python + Go). Failure isolation; the distributed-monolith trap. |
| 20 | **Security architecture** | Gitea's authentication as a port with many adapters and its ordered, default-deny authorization model. OWASP Top 10, trust boundaries, secrets, STRIDE. |
| 21 | **Documentation: ADRs & the C4 model** | Record decisions as ADRs; draw diagrams that survive contact with reality. |
| **22–29** | **Exam project** | *No teaching.* Each group finds a real project at a real customer, maps the company's architecture, then designs, implements, and defends an architecture of their own choosing; present and defend it at the exam. |

## Projects & exam

- **Foundations group assignment (issued S5, "Containerised Toolbox")** — a small runnable `docker compose` project (a group-written bash tool + `Dockerfile` + a 2-service compose file, on GitHub). Pass/needs-rework; ties together the infrastructure block.
- **Mid-semester project (14–17)** — a small distributed system, built as a **modular monolith**. (Microservices vs monoliths, **Session 19**, later unpacks the trade-off behind that choice.)
- **Exam project (22–29)** — the assessment. Each group finds a real project at a real customer, maps the company's architecture, then designs, implements, and defends an architecture of their own choosing, before presenting and defending it. The exam exercises every concept introduced across the semester.

## How to read this course

- **Hands-on first.** Engage with the in-class activity and the after-class investigation before the optional readings.
- **Verify everything.** When the agent tells you how a system works, open the file and check. The habit *is* the skill.
- **Shape over language.** You'll read Go (Gitea), Python and Kotlin (the spine and examples), and a Go gateway — because architecture is about structure, which survives the choice of language.
