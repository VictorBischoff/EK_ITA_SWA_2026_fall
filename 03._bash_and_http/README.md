# Session 3: The Command Line — Pipes, HTTP & M2M Security

**ITA Software Architecture 2026 Fall | 3 hours | Foundations block (hands-on)**

> The Unix idea: small tools that each do one thing, joined together. Today you'll learn to *compose* commands with pipes to answer real questions about data. Then you'll meet `curl` and just enough **HTTP** to talk to a web service — and, crucially, how machines talk to each other **securely**: HTTPS, certificates, and how one machine proves its identity to another. That last part is the heart of *interoperability security*, which you'll rely on for the rest of the semester.

---

## Learning Goals

- Understand **stdin / stdout / stderr** and wire commands together with **pipes** and **redirection**.
- Use the core text tools — `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cut`, `find`, and a little `sed`/`awk` — to slice data.
- Use **`curl`** to make HTTP requests; read methods, status codes, headers, and JSON.
- Explain how **machine-to-machine communication is secured**: HTTPS/TLS, certificates (encryption + server identity), and **API authentication** (keys, bearer tokens, a word on mTLS).

---

## Before Class

- Have your **webtop Linux container** from Session 2 running, with a terminal open.
- Have your Git repo cloned inside it (you'll commit today's work).

---

## Today's Teachings

> **Everything today runs *inside the webtop container* from Session 2, not on your laptop** — same terminal, same machine. `curl`, the text tools, and `openssl` all live in the container; `localhost` means the container. If you open a fresh laptop terminal by mistake, the commands may be missing or behave differently.

### Part 0 — Warm-up (10 min)
Quick recap of last week's navigation, then `cd` into a seeded `session-03/` folder with a sample **log file** and a **CSV**.

### Part 1 — Streams, pipes & redirection (30 min) — blackboard + keyboard
On the board: every program has three streams — **stdin**, **stdout**, **stderr**. The two moves that change everything:

- **Pipe** `|` — feed one command's output into the next: `cat access.log | wc -l`.
- **Redirect** `>` (overwrite), `>>` (append), `<` (from file): `ls > files.txt`.

The Unix philosophy: don't hunt for one big command — *chain small ones*.

### Part 2 — The text toolkit (40 min) — keyboard
Each tool, used immediately on the sample log:

- `grep` (find lines), `wc -l` (count), `sort` / `sort -n`, `uniq -c` (count duplicates).
- `cut -d',' -f1` (a CSV column), `find` (locate files), a taste of `sed 's/old/new/'` and `awk '{print $1}'`.

**Live set-piece — "the 5 busiest IPs":** build it one stage at a time, re-running as it grows:

```bash
cut -d' ' -f1 access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5
```

Plus a 5-min note on **exit codes** (`echo $?`), env vars (`echo $HOME`, `export`), and `PATH`.

### Part 3 — Talking to the web with curl + HTTP (35 min) — keyboard
`curl` fetches URLs. Just enough HTTP to use it:

- **Methods:** `GET` (read) vs `POST` (send): `curl https://api.github.com/users/torvalds`.
- **Status codes:** `200`/`404`/`500`; see them with `curl -i` and `curl -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"`.
- **Headers** and **JSON bodies**; sending data: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}' <url>`.
- Pipe a JSON response into the Part-2 tools to pull out a field.

> A preview, not the full story — we design HTTP APIs properly later. Today: *poke* a web service from the terminal.

### Part 4 — Securing machine-to-machine communication (40 min) — blackboard + keyboard — the set-piece
When two machines exchange data over a network, two questions matter: **can anyone on the path read it?** and **how does each side know who it's talking to?** This is *interoperability security* — the everyday reality behind every API call.

- **Why plain HTTP is unsafe:** the request and response travel in the clear — any hop between can read or alter them. Blackboard: client → … → server, with an eavesdropper in the middle.
- **HTTPS = HTTP over TLS.** TLS gives two things: **encryption in transit** (eavesdroppers see gibberish) and **server identity** via a **certificate**. `curl` checks the certificate automatically — that's what the padlock means.
- **Certificates & trust:** a certificate is signed by a **Certificate Authority (CA)** your system already trusts. Inspect a real one:
  ```bash
  curl -v https://api.github.com 2>&1 | grep -Ei "subject|issuer|SSL"
  openssl s_client -connect api.github.com:443 </dev/null   # see the cert chain
  ```
  What `curl` does on a **bad/expired cert** (it refuses), and `-k`/`--insecure` to skip the check — *and why doing that in real life defeats the point.*
- **Authentication — how a machine proves who it is:** servers don't trust anonymous callers. The common patterns:
  - **API key / bearer token** in a header: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" <url>` — and why the token lives in an **environment variable / secret**, never hard-coded or committed (callback to S2's "don't commit secrets").
  - **mutual TLS (mTLS)** in one sentence: *both* sides present certificates — used between trusted back-end services.
- **The tie-in:** this is exactly how services talk safely in a distributed system — forward link to **REST APIs**, **microservices**, and the **Security** session later in the semester.

### Part 5 — Wrap-up (10 min)
Two threads, recapped: compose small tools; and machines exchange data over channels that must be *encrypted* and *authenticated*. Commit today's work.

## Exercise (in class)

Using **only the terminal**, save your commands to a file and push:

- From the log: total requests, error count, the 5 busiest IPs, the busiest hour.
- From the CSV: extract a column, sort it, count unique values.
- With `curl`: fetch a **public HTTPS API**, show its status code, and extract one field from the JSON.
- **Inspect the server's certificate** (`curl -v …` or `openssl s_client`): who issued it, who it's for.
- Make one **authenticated request** using a token in an `Authorization` header, with the token read from an **environment variable** (not written in the file).
- Save commands in `answers.sh` (commented) and **push to GitHub** — with no secret in the file.

---

## After Class

- Re-solve two exercise questions a *different* way (same answer, different tools).
- In one sentence each: what does HTTPS protect that HTTP doesn't, and how does a server know an API request came from *you*?

---

## Optional

- [optional] *The Linux Command Line* (Shotts), Part 2 — redirection, pipes, text tools.
- [optional] *How HTTPS works* (`https://howhttps.works`) — a friendly illustrated walk-through of TLS and certificates.
- [optional] Skim `man curl` EXAMPLES, and the `--cert`/`--cacert` options to see where mTLS plugs in.
